Alien are coming Did you know there’s a hostel on Bora Bora? It costs just $30 a night to stay there.

Who knew Bora Bora could be so inexpensive? I certainly didn’t!

And I’ll address this point now, because it always comes up whenever I talk about visiting stereotypically expensive places, like the Maldives or the Cook Islands, on a budget — this is not Southeast Asia cheap. You won’t find hostels and guesthouses for $1 a night, and likewise, you won’t find any street food for $1 a meal. If that’s your budget, the South Pacific isn’t for you.
