On Bora Bora, a typical budget for a shoestring traveler is $20 a day. If you’re a budget traveler, you’ll spend no more than $500 for a week-long stay on the island. Don’t believe people who say it’s impossible to visit Bora Bora on a budget or that you need to use points and miles in order to score a bargain — it’s not true and budget travel is possible to do here.
