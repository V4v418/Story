So can you visit Bora Bora on a budget?

Absolutely! 

I was surprised by how easy it is to do so. After booking my flight, I jumped online, sorted the nightly accommodation prices on Booking.com from low to high and was greeted with several guesthouses and hotels for well under $150 per person per night. A quick google of affordable guesthouses on the island brought up even more options that weren’t listed online — there were dozens of well-reviewed guesthouses for as little as $50 a night.
